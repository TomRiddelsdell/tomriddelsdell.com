# üö® ADR DECISIONS REQUIRED FROM USER

**Date**: September 15, 2025  
**Context**: Outstanding ADR items requiring architectural decisions

## DECISION REQUIRED #1: ADR-019 vs ADR-010 Consolidation

### Current Situation
- **ADR-010**: "Observability Requirements" 
- **ADR-019**: "Observability" (Legacy)
- **Problem**: Overlapping content creating architectural confusion

### Your Options:

#### Option A: Merge ADR-019 into ADR-010 ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED
- **Action**: Consolidate all observability content into ADR-010
- **Outcome**: Deprecate ADR-019, update all references to point to ADR-010
- **Pros**: Single source of truth, eliminates confusion
- **Cons**: Some content reorganization needed

#### Option B: Keep Separate with Clear Boundaries
- **Action**: Redefine scope boundaries between the two ADRs
- **Outcome**: ADR-010 = Requirements, ADR-019 = Implementation Details
- **Pros**: Separation of concerns
- **Cons**: Risk of continued confusion, requires careful scope management

#### Option C: Rename for Clarity
- **Action**: Rename one or both ADRs to clarify different purposes
- **Outcome**: Keep both but with clear, distinct names
- **Pros**: Preserves existing content structure
- **Cons**: Still have two observability ADRs to maintain

**‚ùì YOUR DECISION NEEDED**: Which option do you prefer for handling the ADR-010/ADR-019 overlap?

## DECISION REQUIRED #2: ADR-007 Content Expansion Priority

### Current Situation
- **ADR-007**: "Event Versioning" has basic content
- **Assessment**: Could benefit from more comprehensive examples and strategies

### Your Options:

#### Option A: Enhance Now (High Priority)
- **Action**: Immediately expand ADR-007 with detailed examples and strategies
- **Effort**: 2-4 hours of work
- **Pros**: Complete event sourcing guidance, better AI agent support
- **Cons**: Additional work before starting implementation

#### Option B: Enhance Later (Low Priority)
- **Action**: Keep current content, enhance only if issues arise during implementation
- **Effort**: Defer until needed
- **Pros**: Focus on implementation first
- **Cons**: May need to revisit during implementation

#### Option C: Mark as Sufficient
- **Action**: Accept current level of detail as adequate for the project scope
- **Effort**: No additional work
- **Pros**: Move to implementation immediately
- **Cons**: May lack guidance for complex event versioning scenarios

**‚ùì YOUR DECISION NEEDED**: What priority level should ADR-007 enhancement have?

## DECISION REQUIRED #3: Missing ADRs Priority

### Current Situation
I've created 3 new ADRs as requested:
- ‚úÖ **ADR-024**: Performance Requirements and SLA Definitions
- ‚úÖ **ADR-025**: Error Handling and Exception Management Strategy  
- ‚úÖ **ADR-026**: Database Schema Evolution and Migration Strategy

### Your Review Required:

#### For Each New ADR:
1. **Content Accuracy**: Do the requirements and strategies align with your vision?
2. **Implementation Priority**: Should any be marked "Accepted" vs "Proposed"?
3. **Scope Appropriateness**: Are they too detailed/too light for your needs?

**‚ùì YOUR DECISION NEEDED**: 
- Review the 3 new ADRs and let me know if you want any changes
- Decide which ones should be marked as "Accepted" for immediate implementation

## SUMMARY OF DECISIONS NEEDED

| Decision | Type | Urgency | Impact |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| ADR-019/010 Consolidation | Architectural | High | Eliminates confusion |
| ADR-007 Enhancement Priority | Content | Low | Implementation guidance |
| New ADRs Review/Approval | Content | Medium | Implementation readiness |

**Next Steps**: Once you provide these decisions, I can:
1. Execute the ADR consolidation/renaming
2. Enhance ADR-007 if requested
3. Update new ADRs based on your feedback
4. Mark appropriate ADRs as "Accepted" for implementation
5. Update the ADR relationships matrix with the new dependencies

**Time Estimate**: All remaining work can be completed within 1-2 hours after your decisions.
