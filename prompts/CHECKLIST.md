# Implementation Checklist

Quick reference checklist for sequential prompt execution.

## Phase 0: Infrastructure Foundation

### □ 0.1 CLI Authentication (30 min)
- [ ] Create Doppler account and project
- [ ] Generate Doppler service token
- [ ] Set DOPPLER_TOKEN environment variable
- [ ] Authenticate GitHub CLI
- [ ] Create Neon account and API key
- [ ] Authenticate Cloudflare Wrangler
- [ ] Setup Confluent Kafka CLI
- [ ] Run verification script (all 5 tools authenticated)

### □ 0.2 Secrets Setup (45 min)
- [ ] Create development environment secrets
- [ ] Configure production environment secrets  
- [ ] Set up staging environment secrets
- [ ] Validate secret access from CLI tools
- [ ] Test secret injection with doppler run

### □ 0.3 Infrastructure Deployment (90 min)
- [ ] Deploy Neon PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Setup Confluent Kafka cluster  
- [ ] Configure Cloudflare DNS and Workers
- [ ] Deploy Terraform infrastructure
- [ ] Validate all services are accessible
- [ ] Test database connectivity
- [ ] Verify Kafka topic creation

### □ 0.4 CI/CD Pipeline (45 min)
- [ ] Create GitHub repository
- [ ] Setup GitHub Actions workflows
- [ ] Configure deployment secrets
- [ ] Test automated deployment pipeline
- [ ] Validate staging deployment
- [ ] Setup production deployment gates

### □ 0.5 Observability Setup (30 min)
- [ ] Configure application monitoring
- [ ] Setup error tracking
- [ ] Create performance dashboards
- [ ] Setup log aggregation
- [ ] Test alert notifications

### □ 0.6 MCP Validation (30 min)
- [ ] Test Neon MCP server connection
- [ ] Validate GitHub MCP server
- [ ] Verify AWS CLI MCP integration
- [ ] Test AI-assisted development workflow
- [ ] Validate all MCP tools functioning

## Phase 1: Walking Skeleton

### □ 1.1 Project Structure (120 min)
- [ ] Create domain-driven directory structure
- [ ] Setup base domain entities and aggregates
- [ ] Implement event sourcing foundation
- [ ] Create basic CQRS structure
- [ ] Setup authentication integration
- [ ] Create initial tests
- [ ] Deploy walking skeleton to staging
- [ ] Validate end-to-end functionality

## Emergency Procedures

### If Authentication Fails
1. Check container environment compatibility
2. Try alternative token-based authentication
3. Verify network connectivity and firewall settings
4. Regenerate API keys and tokens
5. Document issue in EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md

### If Infrastructure Deployment Fails
1. Check Terraform state and logs
2. Verify cloud provider quotas and limits
3. Check DNS propagation and networking
4. Run `terraform destroy` to clean up if needed
5. Document issue and retry with corrected configuration

### If CI/CD Pipeline Fails
1. Check GitHub Actions logs and permissions
2. Verify secrets are properly configured
3. Test deployment manually first
4. Check branch protection rules and requirements
5. Validate container image builds and pushes

## Success Criteria

### Phase 0 Complete When:
- ✅ All 5 CLI tools authenticated and functional
- ✅ Infrastructure deployed and accessible
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline successfully deploying
- ✅ Monitoring and observability active
- ✅ MCP servers responding and integrated

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- ✅ Domain structure follows DDD principles
- ✅ Event sourcing pattern implemented
- ✅ Authentication system integrated
- ✅ Tests are passing
- ✅ Application deploys via CI/CD
- ✅ End-to-end functionality validated

**Total Estimated Time**: 6.5 hours  
**Recommended Approach**: Complete Phase 0 in one session, take break, then Phase 1  
**Critical Path**: Each step depends on previous completion
