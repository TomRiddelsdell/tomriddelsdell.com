# DDD Refactoring Phase 5: Notification Domain

## Overview
Phase 5 implements the final domain in our comprehensive DDD architecture - the Notification Domain. This domain handles all communication, alerting, and notification requirements across the FlowCreate platform with multi-channel delivery capabilities and sophisticated event-driven architecture.

## Notification Domain Architecture

### Core Entities

#### 1. Notification
- **Purpose**: Represents a single notification message with delivery tracking
- **Key Attributes**: 
  - NotificationId (value object)
  - UserId, Title, Content, Type
  - Priority (low, normal, high, urgent)
  - Status (pending, sent, delivered, failed, read)
  - Channels (email, sms, push, in-app)
  - ScheduledAt, SentAt, ReadAt
  - Metadata for templating and personalization

#### 2. NotificationTemplate
- **Purpose**: Reusable templates for consistent messaging
- **Key Attributes**:
  - TemplateId, Name, Subject, Body
  - Type (welcome, alert, reminder, report)
  - Variables for dynamic content
  - Channel-specific formatting
  - Active status and versioning

#### 3. NotificationChannel
- **Purpose**: Configuration for different delivery channels
- **Key Attributes**:
  - ChannelId, Type (email, sms, push, webhook)
  - Configuration (SMTP, API keys, endpoints)
  - Rate limits and retry policies
  - Health status and performance metrics

#### 4. Subscription
- **Purpose**: User preferences for notification delivery
- **Key Attributes**:
  - SubscriptionId, UserId, NotificationType
  - Enabled channels and frequency preferences
  - Quiet hours and timezone settings
  - Filter criteria and custom rules

### Value Objects

#### NotificationId
- Unique identifier for notifications
- Type-safe wrapper with validation

#### Priority
- Enumeration: LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, URGENT
- Affects delivery timing and channel selection

#### Channel
- Enumeration: EMAIL, SMS, PUSH, IN_APP, WEBHOOK
- Each with specific configuration requirements

### Domain Services

#### NotificationDeliveryService
- Orchestrates multi-channel delivery
- Handles retry logic and fallback channels
- Tracks delivery status and performance metrics

#### TemplateRenderingService
- Processes templates with dynamic variables
- Supports multiple formats (HTML, text, markdown)
- Handles localization and personalization

#### SubscriptionManagementService
- Manages user preferences and consent
- Enforces compliance with privacy regulations
- Handles opt-in/opt-out workflows

### Application Layer

#### Command Handlers
- **SendNotificationCommand**: Immediate notification delivery
- **ScheduleNotificationCommand**: Delayed delivery scheduling
- **CreateTemplateCommand**: Template management
- **UpdateSubscriptionCommand**: Preference management
- **SendBulkNotificationCommand**: Mass notification delivery

#### Query Handlers
- **GetNotificationHistoryQuery**: User notification timeline
- **GetDeliveryStatusQuery**: Tracking and analytics
- **GetSubscriptionPreferencesQuery**: User settings
- **GetNotificationStatsQuery**: Performance metrics

#### Event Handlers
- **WorkflowCompletedEvent**: Workflow completion notifications
- **IntegrationFailedEvent**: Error alerting
- **AnalyticsThresholdReachedEvent**: Performance alerts
- **UserRegisteredEvent**: Welcome sequences

### Infrastructure Layer

#### Adapters
- **EmailNotificationAdapter**: SMTP/SendGrid integration
- **SMSNotificationAdapter**: Twilio/AWS SNS integration
- **PushNotificationAdapter**: Firebase/APNS integration
- **WebhookNotificationAdapter**: HTTP callback delivery

#### Repositories
- **NotificationRepository**: Notification persistence
- **TemplateRepository**: Template storage and versioning
- **SubscriptionRepository**: User preference management

## Integration Points

### With Analytics Domain
- Delivery performance metrics
- User engagement tracking
- A/B testing for template effectiveness

- Execution milestone alerts
- Error and completion notifications

### With Integration Domain
- API failure notifications
- Data sync status updates
- Connection health alerts

## Event-Driven Architecture

### Domain Events
- **NotificationSentEvent**: Delivery confirmation
- **NotificationFailedEvent**: Delivery failure tracking

- Channel optimization based on success rates
- Automatic fallback to alternative channels

### 2. Compliance and Privacy
- GDPR consent management
- CAN-SPAM compliance
- Opt-out tracking and enforcement
- Data retention policies

### 3. Real-time Capabilities
- WebSocket connections for instant notifications
- Live delivery status updates
- Real-time preference synchronization

### 4. Advanced Analytics
- Delivery rate optimization
- User engagement scoring
- Channel performance comparison
- Cost per delivery analysis

## Implementation Strategy

2. Implement domain services for delivery and templating
3. Create repository interfaces and basic implementations
4. Establish event-driven communication patterns

### Phase 5.2: Application Layer
1. Implement command and query handlers
2. Create event handlers for cross-domain integration
3. Build notification orchestration workflows
4. Add comprehensive validation and error handling

### Phase 5.3: Infrastructure Integration
1. Implement email and SMS delivery adapters
2. Add push notification capabilities
3. Create webhook delivery mechanisms
4. Integrate with existing database and storage

### Phase 5.4: Advanced Features
