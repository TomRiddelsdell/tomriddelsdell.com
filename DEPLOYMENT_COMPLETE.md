3. **Add GitHub secrets** with your AWS account details
4. **Push to GitHub** to trigger your first deployment

## 📋 Quick Start

When you have valid AWS credentials:

```bash
# 1. Run the manual setup guide
./infrastructure/deployment/aws/scripts/setup-github-actions-manual.sh

# 3. Test a deployment (dry run)
./infrastructure/deployment/aws/scripts/deploy.sh -e staging --dry-run
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Complete AWS setup** using the manual guide commands
2. **Configure GitHub secrets** with your actual AWS values
3. **Set up environment protection** for production deployments
4. **Push to develop branch** to test staging deployment
5. **Create PR to main** to test production pipeline
