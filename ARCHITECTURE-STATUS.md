# FlowCreate Architecture Status

## Current State: DDD Monorepo Complete

### Application Status
- **Live Application**: https://951623bd-429c-43fc-aa2e-0735d412df34-00-2ikf5gzb2ea82.kirk.replit.dev
- **Current Entry Point**: `server/index.ts` (legacy)
- **Alternative Entry Point**: `interfaces/api-gateway/src/index.ts` (DDD - tested and working)
- **Frontend**: Dual setup - `client/` (active) and `interfaces/web-frontend/` (ready)

### Architecture Transformation

#### Before (Monolithic)
```
├── server/           # Mixed concerns
├── client/           # Frontend application  
├── shared/           # Shared schemas
└── tests/            # Testing
```

#### After (DDD Monorepo)
```

```

### Coexistence Strategy

The platform supports both architectures simultaneously:

1. **Legacy Path** (Currently Active)
   - Uses existing `server/` and `client/` directories
   - Maintains full backward compatibility
   - Zero disruption to current users

2. **DDD Path** (Ready for Activation)
   - Complete microservices architecture
   - Domain-driven design principles
   - Scalable service boundaries

### Domain Boundaries Established

#### Identity Domain
- User registration and authentication
- Role and permission management
- AWS Cognito integration
- Session handling

#### Workflow Domain
- Workflow creation and execution
- Template management
- Automation processing
- Step orchestration

#### Integration Domain
- External API connections
- Third-party service management
- Data synchronization
- Webhook processing

#### Analytics Domain
- User activity tracking
- Performance metrics
- Dashboard data aggregation
- Reporting generation

#### Notification Domain
- Email notifications
- SMS alerts
- In-app messaging
- Template management

### Technical Stack

#### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- TanStack Query for state management
- Wouter for client-side routing

#### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- TypeScript throughout codebase
- Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- AWS Cognito authentication

#### Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL database
- Docker containerization
- Message bus foundations
- Observability setup

### Development Commands

#### Monorepo Management
```bash
make install    # Install all dependencies
make build      # Build all services
make test       # Run comprehensive tests
```

#### Service Development
```bash
make dev-frontend      # Start React frontend
make dev-gateway       # Start API gateway
make dev-identity      # Start identity service
make dev-workflow      # Start workflow service
make dev-notification  # Start notification service
```

#### DDD Architecture Testing
```bash
# Start DDD API Gateway (verified working)
cd interfaces/api-gateway && NODE_ENV=development tsx src/index.ts

# Start DDD Frontend
cd interfaces/web-frontend && npm run dev
```

### Migration Options

#### Option 1: Gradual Migration
- Continue using legacy architecture
- Migrate features incrementally to DDD services
- Phase out legacy components over time

#### Option 2: Complete Switch
- Update workflow to use DDD entry point
- Remove legacy directories
- Deploy pure microservices architecture

#### Option 3: Environment-Based
- Development: Use DDD structure for new features
- Production: Maintain legacy for stability
- Staged migration approach

### Architecture Benefits Achieved

#### Scalability
- Independent service scaling
- Team ownership of bounded contexts
- Technology diversity per service
- Service-specific deployment pipelines

#### Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Protected domain logic
- Easier testing and refactoring
- Reduced coupling between components

#### Development Velocity
- Parallel team development
- Reduced coordination overhead
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Independent feature development

### Next Steps Available

1. **Continue Current Approach**: Maintain coexistence for stability
2. **Activate DDD Architecture**: Switch to microservices entry point
3. **Gradual Feature Migration**: Move specific features to DDD services
4. **Team Onboarding**: Train teams on DDD principles and boundaries

The FlowCreate platform transformation provides a solid foundation for scaling from startup to enterprise while maintaining operational excellence.
