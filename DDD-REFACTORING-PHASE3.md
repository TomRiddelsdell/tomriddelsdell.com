# DDD Refactoring Phase 3: Integration Domain

## Overview
Phase 3 extracts the Integration domain, focusing on external service connections, API integrations, and data synchronization. This domain manages the complexity of third-party service interactions and provides a clean abstraction layer for external dependencies.

## Domain Boundaries

### Integration Domain
**Core Responsibility**: Managing external service connections and data flow between systems

**Key Entities:**
- **Integration**: Represents a connection to an external service
- **ApiConnection**: Manages API endpoint configurations and authentication
- **DataMapping**: Handles data transformation between systems
- **SyncJob**: Manages scheduled data synchronization tasks

**Value Objects:**
- **IntegrationId**: Unique identifier for integrations
- **ApiEndpoint**: URL and configuration for API endpoints
- **AuthCredentials**: Secure credential management
- **DataSchema**: Structure definition for data mapping

**Domain Services:**
- **IntegrationExecutionService**: Orchestrates integration workflows
- **DataTransformationService**: Handles data mapping and transformation
- **SyncSchedulingService**: Manages synchronization schedules

## Domain Rules

### Integration Entity Rules
1. **Connection Validation**: All integrations must have valid authentication before activation
2. **Rate Limiting**: Integrations must respect external service rate limits
3. **Error Handling**: Failed integrations must be retried with exponential backoff
4. **Security**: Credentials must be encrypted and rotated regularly

### Data Mapping Rules
1. **Schema Validation**: All data transformations must validate against defined schemas
2. **Data Integrity**: Transformations must preserve data integrity and handle null values
3. **Versioning**: Data mappings must support schema versioning for backward compatibility

### Sync Job Rules
1. **Scheduling**: Sync jobs must have defined schedules and execution windows
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Data conflicts must be resolved according to defined strategies
3. **Audit Trail**: All sync operations must be logged for audit purposes

## Integration Points

### With Workflow Domain
- Workflows can trigger integrations as action steps
- Integration status updates can trigger workflow events
- Data from integrations can be used in workflow conditions

### With Identity Domain
- User permissions control integration access
- User contexts are passed to integrations for personalization
- Integration logs are associated with user activities

### Current System Integration
- Maintains compatibility with existing connected apps
- Preserves current API endpoints and data structures
- Extends functionality without breaking changes

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Create Domain Layer**: Define entities, value objects, and domain services
2. **Implement Application Layer**: Add CQRS commands, queries, and handlers
3. **Build Infrastructure Layer**: Create repositories and external service adapters
4. **Add Integration Module**: Wire everything together with dependency injection
5. **Create Adapter Layer**: Maintain backward compatibility with existing system
6. **Add Comprehensive Tests**: Ensure domain logic, application layer, and integration work correctly

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between internal workflow logic and external integrations
2. **Testability**: External dependencies can be easily mocked and tested
3. **Scalability**: Integration processing can be scaled independently
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to external services are isolated to the integration domain
5. **Security**: Centralized credential management and security policies
6. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive integration health monitoring and alerting
