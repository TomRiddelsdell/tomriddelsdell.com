# ADR Relationship Matrix

**Purpose**: This document maps the dependencies and relationships b### Missing Dependencies

### Critical Gaps Identified
These architectural areas lack ADRs but are referenced by existing decisions:

| Missing ADR | Priority | Required By | Estimated Effort | Status |
|-------------|----------|-------------|------------------|--------|
| ~~API Design Standards~~ | ~~High~~ | ~~ADR-013, ADR-012~~ | ~~Medium~~ | ✅ **Created ADR-020** |
| ~~Testing Strategy~~ | ~~High~~ | ~~All implementation ADRs~~ | ~~High~~ | ✅ **Created ADR-021** |
| Performance Requirements | Medium | ADR-010, ADR-012 | Medium | ❌ **Still needed** |
| Error Handling Strategy | Medium | ADR-006, ADR-011 | Low | ❌ **Still needed** |
| Database Migration Strategy | Medium | ADR-006, ADR-008 | Low | ❌ **Still needed** |to guide implementation order and ensure consistency.

## Implementation Layers

### Application Layer
These ADRs define the application and infrastructure implementation.

| ADR | Title | Status | Dependencies | Required By |
|-----|-------|--------|--------------|-------------|

| ADR-018 | OAuth Authorization | Proposed | ADR-003 | None |
| ADR-019 | Observability (Legacy) | Accepted | ADR-010 | **MERGE INTO ADR-010** |

## Critical Path Analysis

### For Greenfield Implementation
**Shortest path to working system:**
```
ADR-001 → ADR-002 → ADR-005 → ADR-006 → ADR-012 → ADR-013
```

### For Event Sourcing Implementation
**Complete event sourcing stack:**
```
ADR-001 → ADR-002 → ADR-005 → ADR-006 → ADR-007 → ADR-008 → ADR-009 → ADR-011 → ADR-012
```

### For Production Deployment
**Full production readiness:**
```
Foundation Layer → Domain Core → Event Sourcing Core → Integration Layer → Application Layer
```

## Conflict Resolution

### Status Conflicts
- **ADR-005 (Domain Model)**: Status shows "Proposed" but is foundational. ***please check*** if this should be "Accepted"
- **ADR-019 vs ADR-010**: Overlapping observability concerns. ***please check*** whether to merge or keep separate

### Content Conflicts
- **ADR-007 (Event Versioning)**: Extremely thin content for such a critical decision. ***please check*** priority for expansion
- **ADR-011 (Message Bus)**: Very complex, may need splitting. ***please check*** if single ADR is preferred

## Missing Dependencies

### Critical Gaps Identified
These architectural areas lack ADRs but are referenced by existing decisions:

| Missing ADR | Priority | Required By | Estimated Effort |
|-------------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| API Design Standards | High | ADR-013, ADR-012 | Medium |
| Testing Strategy | High | All implementation ADRs | High |
| Performance Requirements | Medium | ADR-010, ADR-012 | Medium |
| Error Handling Strategy | Medium | ADR-006, ADR-011 | Low |
| Database Migration Strategy | Medium | ADR-006, ADR-008 | Low |

## Evolution Tracking

### Recently Changed
- **September 10, 2025**: Standardized naming conventions (ADR-001 through ADR-019)
- **September 10, 2025**: Created relationship matrix
- **September 10, 2025**: Added new implementation ADRs (ADR-020, ADR-021, ADR-022, ADR-023)
- **September 10, 2025**: Split ADR-011 into high-level strategy + implementation details

### Planned Changes
- **Phase 1**: Complete ADR-011 splitting and update references ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Phase 2**: Create remaining missing ADRs (Performance, Error Handling, Database Migration)
- **Phase 3**: Upgrade remaining thin content ADRs

### Review Schedule
- **Monthly**: Implementation status review
- **Quarterly**: Relationship matrix validation
- **As needed**: When new ADRs are proposed

## AI Agent Implementation Guidance

### For AI Agents Starting Implementation:

1. **Always start with Foundation Layer** - No exceptions
2. **Check status before implementing** - Only implement "Accepted" ADRs unless explicitly told otherwise
3. **Follow dependency chain** - Never skip required dependencies
4. **Validate at each layer** - Ensure lower layers work before moving up

### Common AI Pitfalls:
- Implementing ADRs out of dependency order
- Ignoring business domain constraints from ADR-001
- Missing event sourcing patterns from ADR-006
- Not considering security requirements from ADR-004
