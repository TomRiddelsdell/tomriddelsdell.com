# ADR-015: Deployment Strategy and CI/CD Pipeline

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We need to define our deployment strategy including CI/CD pipeline design, database migration handling, disaster recovery planning, blue/green deployments, and monitoring/alerting infrastructure. This strategy must support our event-sourced, multi-service architecture while maintaining simplicity for initial development.

## Decision

### Deployment Architecture Strategy

**Hybrid Deployment Architecture Implemented:**

- **Decentralized App-Centric Deployment**: Each application/service owns its deployment configuration and process
- **Technology Agnostic**: Apps can use different tech stacks (Node.js, Python, Docker, static sites)
- **Universal Makefile Interface**: Root Makefile provides consistent deployment commands across all apps
- **Platform-Specific Logic**: Apps deploy to their target platforms (Cloudflare Workers/Pages, AWS ECS/Lambda/S3)
- **Shared Deployment Functions**: Common deployment patterns abstracted into reusable functions

**Implemented Directory Structure:**

        ├── deploy.yml            # Main deployment pipeline (IMPLEMENTED)
        ├── test.yml              # Testing pipeline (IMPLEMENTED)
        ├── security.yml          # Security scanning (IMPLEMENTED)
        └── quality.yml           # Code quality checks (IMPLEMENTED)
```

**Universal Deployment Commands (IMPLEMENTED):**

```bash
# Deploy all applications and services
make deploy-all ENV=development

# Deploy specific application with change detection
make deploy-app APP=landing-page ENV=production

# Deploy specific service
make deploy-service SERVICE=accounts ENV=development

# Test all components
make test-all

# Health check all deployed services
make health-check-all ENV=production

# Setup development environment
make setup-env

# List available components
make list-apps
make list-services
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Design

**GitHub Actions as Primary CI/CD:**

- **Change Detection**: Path-based triggers deploy only modified applications
- **Parallel Deployment**: Independent apps deploy simultaneously when possible
- **Platform-Aware**: Different deployment strategies per target platform
- **Universal Commands**: CI/CD uses same Makefile interface as local development

**Pipeline Stages:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/orchestrate-deploy.yml structure
stages:
  - detect-changes:   # Identify modified apps using dorny/paths-filter
  - quality-gates:    # Run tests only for changed apps + dependencies
  - deploy-apps:      # Deploy each changed app using its Makefile
  - validate-deploy:  # Health checks for deployed services
```

**Deployment Orchestration:**

```makefile
# Root Makefile interface
make deploy-all ENV=development     # Deploy all apps to development
make deploy-app APP=apps/landing-page ENV=production  # Deploy specific app
make test-all                       # Test all apps
make test-app APP=services/accounts # Test specific app
```

**Code Quality Gates:**

- **SonarQube integration**: Quality gate must pass before deployment
- **Coverage threshold**: Minimum 80% test coverage for new code
- **Security scanning**: SAST/DAST scans must pass
- **Dependency scanning**: Vulnerability checks for all dependencies
- **Code duplication**: Maximum 3% duplication allowed

**Environment Promotion:**
- **Feature branches**: Developed and tested locally (not deployed)
- **Develop branch**: Auto-deploy to staging environment (pre-production validation)
- **Main branch**: Automatic production deployment after successful quality gates
- **Rollback capability**: Previous versions tagged and available for quick rollback

### Code Quality Strategy

**SonarQube Integration:**
- **Quality profiles**: Custom profiles for TypeScript, JavaScript, and SQL
- **Quality gates**: Enforce coverage, reliability, security, and maintainability thresholds
- **Pull request decoration**: SonarQube analysis results displayed in PR reviews
- **Technical debt tracking**: Monitor and track technical debt over time

**SonarQube Configuration:**
```yaml
# sonar-project.properties
sonar.projectKey=tomriddelsdell-platform
sonar.organization=tomriddelsdell
sonar.sources=src/
sonar.tests=src/
sonar.test.inclusions=**/*.test.ts,**/*.spec.ts
sonar.coverage.exclusions=**/*.test.ts,**/*.spec.ts,**/migrations/**
sonar.typescript.lcov.reportPaths=coverage/lcov.info
sonar.javascript.lcov.reportPaths=coverage/lcov.info

# Quality Gate Conditions
sonar.qualitygate.wait=true
coverage.threshold=80
reliability_rating.threshold=A
security_rating.threshold=A
maintainability_rating.threshold=A
duplicated_lines_density.threshold=3
```

**Automated Quality Checks:**
- **Pre-commit hooks**: ESLint, Prettier, type checking
- **PR quality checks**: SonarQube analysis, security scans, test coverage
- **Deployment gates**: All quality checks must pass before production deployment
- **Quality metrics**: Track trends in technical debt, coverage, and code quality

### Database Migration Strategy

**Event Store Migration Approach:**
- **Schema evolution**: Additive changes only (new columns, tables, indexes)
- **Breaking changes**: Implement as new event types with upcasting
- **Migration scripts**: Stored in `/migrations` with version numbering
- **Rollback strategy**: Forward-only migrations with compensating scripts

**Projection Migration Strategy:**
- **Projection rebuilds**: Full rebuilds from event history when schema changes
- **Zero-downtime updates**: New projection versions run in parallel during migration
- **Checkpoint management**: Track migration progress and resume capability
- **Validation**: Compare old vs new projections before switching traffic

**Migration Process:**
1. **Pre-deployment**: Validate migration scripts in staging
2. **Deployment**: Apply additive schema changes first
3. **Data migration**: Rebuild affected projections from events
4. **Validation**: Verify data integrity and performance
5. **Cleanup**: Remove deprecated schemas after successful migration

### Disaster Recovery Plan

**Backup Strategies:**
- **Event store backups**: Daily automated backups with 30-day retention
- **Point-in-time recovery**: Leverage Neon's PITR capabilities (7-day window initially)
- **Cross-region replication**: Event store replicated to secondary region
- **Projection backups**: Daily snapshots of projection databases

**Recovery Time/Point Objectives:**
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours for full service restoration
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 1 hour maximum data loss
- **Critical path**: Event store → Core projections → Application services

**Disaster Scenarios:**
- **Database corruption**: Restore from PITR or latest backup
- **Region failure**: Failover to secondary region with event store replica
- **Application bugs**: Rollback to previous version + projection rebuild
- **Data center outage**: Cloudflare Workers provide geographic distribution

### Blue/Green and Canary Deployments

**Initial Approach: Simple Blue/Green**
- **Blue environment**: Current production version
- **Green environment**: New version deployed and tested
- **Traffic switching**: DNS-based cutover via Cloudflare
- **Rollback**: Immediate DNS switch back to blue environment
- **Automated health checks**: New version must pass health checks before traffic switch

**Canary Strategy (Future):**
- **Traffic percentage**: Start with 5% traffic to new version
- **Monitoring period**: 30 minutes before increasing traffic
- **Success criteria**: Error rates < 1%, latency within 10% of baseline
- **Automatic rollback**: If error thresholds exceeded

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Deployment configuration
interface DeploymentConfig {
  strategy: 'blue-green' | 'canary';
  canaryPercentage?: number;
  monitoringPeriod: string;
  rollbackThresholds: {
    errorRate: number;
    latencyIncrease: number;
  };
  qualityGates: {
    sonarQube: boolean;
    testCoverage: number;
    securityScan: boolean;
    healthChecks: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Monitoring and Alerting

**Service Level Indicators (SLIs):**
- **Availability**: 99.5% uptime for core user journeys
- **Latency**: 95th percentile response time < 2 seconds
- **Error rate**: < 1% error rate for API requests
- **Event processing lag**: < 5 minutes for projection updates

**Service Level Objectives (SLOs):**
- **Monthly uptime**: 99.5% (3.6 hours downtime per month)
- **API response time**: P95 < 2s, P99 < 5s
- **Event processing**: 95% of events processed within 1 minute
- **Error budget**: 0.5% monthly error budget for graceful degradation

**Alerting Strategy:**
- **Critical alerts**: Page immediately (uptime, security, data loss)
- **Warning alerts**: Slack notifications (performance degradation, high error rates)
- **Info alerts**: Dashboard updates (capacity planning, trends)

**Monitoring Stack:**
- **Application metrics**: Custom metrics via Cloudflare Workers analytics
- **Infrastructure metrics**: Neon database monitoring + custom dashboards
- **Log aggregation**: Cloudflare Workers logs + structured logging
- **Alerting**: Cloudflare notifications + webhook integrations

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Kubernetes-based deployment**: Too complex for current scale
2. **Multi-cloud strategy**: Unnecessary complexity for MVP
3. **Complex canary deployments**: Premature optimization
4. **Real-time database replication**: Cost vs benefit not justified initially
5. **Manual production approvals**: Creates deployment bottleneck and reduces velocity
6. **Alternative code quality tools**: Considered CodeClimate and Codacy, but SonarQube provides better integration and customization

## Consequences

**Benefits:**
- **Simple, reliable deployments** using proven GitHub Actions
- **Quick rollback capability** via blue/green switching
- **Comprehensive monitoring** aligned with business objectives
- **Automated testing and quality gates** prevent deployment of broken code
- **Database safety** through additive migrations and PITR
- **Continuous quality improvement** through SonarQube integration
- **Faster deployment velocity** without manual approval bottlenecks

**Drawbacks:**
- **GitHub Actions dependency** creates single point of failure
- **Limited canary capabilities** initially
- **Cross-region complexity** deferred to future phases
- **Quality gate failures** may block deployments temporarily
- **SonarQube maintenance** adds operational overhead

## Trade-offs

**Automation vs Control:**
- Choosing automated deployment over manual approval gates
- Relying on comprehensive quality checks instead of human approval

**Quality vs Speed:**
- Enforcing quality gates may slow individual deployments
