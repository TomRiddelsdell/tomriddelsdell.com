# ADR-004: Security and Compliance Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The platform needs a comprehensive security and compliance strategy that addresses:

- Data protection regulations (GDPR) for EU users
- Authentication and session security
- API rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Audit logging for security events
- Data retention and deletion policies
- Password and credential management

The platform operates as a personal portfolio with professional standards but doesn't require enterprise-grade or financial services-level security.

## Decision

We will implement a **Graduated Security Strategy** appropriate for a personal portfolio platform with professional standards:

### Environment Variable Architecture

**Decision**: Implement a **Two-Tier Environment Variable System** that balances security, developer experience, and operational simplicity.

**Architecture**:

- **Host-Level Variables**: Only essential development variables injected from host system
  - `DEV_EMAIL`: Developer email for git configuration and notifications
  - `DEV_USER_NAME`: Developer name for git configuration
  - `DOPPLER_TOKEN`: Service token for accessing Doppler secret management
- **Doppler-Managed Secrets**: All sensitive API keys and tokens managed via Doppler
  - Cloudflare API tokens, Neon database keys, AWS credentials
  - GitHub tokens, Confluent Kafka credentials
  - All production and staging environment secrets
- **Container Integration**: Automatic injection of Doppler secrets into dev container environment
- **Security Boundary**: Clear separation between host system and sensitive credentials

**Benefits**:

- **Minimal Host Exposure**: Only 3 core variables exposed at host level
- **Centralized Secret Management**: All sensitive data managed through Doppler
- **Developer Experience**: Seamless container-based development with automatic secret loading
- **Security**: Sensitive credentials never stored on host filesystem or in git
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new secrets without host system changes

### Compliance Requirements

- **GDPR Compliance**: Basic compliance for EU users including data subject rights
- **No Enterprise Compliance**: SOC2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS not required for current scope
- **Privacy-First Design**: Built-in privacy protections and data minimization

### Authentication Security

- **AWS Cognito Security**: Leverage managed authentication service security features
- **Strong Password Policy**: 8+ characters with complexity requirements
- **MFA Ready**: Currently disabled but can be enabled when needed
- **Token Security**: Short-lived access tokens (60 min) with longer refresh tokens (5 days)
- **Session Management**: 3-minute auth session validity with secure token revocation

### API Security

- **Per-User Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse with user-specific rate limits
- **Cognito Built-in Throttling**: Leverage AWS throttling for auth endpoints
- **HTTPS Everywhere**: All communication over encrypted channels
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured cross-origin resource sharing

### Data Protection

- **Data Retention**: Follow GDPR requirements for data subject rights
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Unused accounts cleaned up after 7 days
- **Minimal Data Collection**: Only collect data necessary for platform function
- **User Data Control**: Users can export, modify, and delete their data

## Implementation Strategy

### Audit Logging

- **Authentication Events**: Standard Cognito audit logging for all auth events
- **Domain Events**: Application-level audit trail for business-critical actions
- **Immutable Logs**: Event sourcing provides immutable audit trail
- **User Actions**: Log user registration, app access grants, and data modifications

### Password and Credential Management

- **Cognito Password Policy**: Enforced complexity requirements
- **Temporary Passwords**: 7-day validity for temporary passwords
- **Account Recovery**: Email-based account recovery mechanism
- **Credential Rotation**: Support for token refresh and credential updates

### Rate Limiting Strategy

- **User-Scoped Limits**: Per-user API request limits to prevent abuse
- **Endpoint-Specific Limits**: Different limits for different API endpoints
- **Authentication Throttling**: Cognito provides built-in brute force protection
- **Graceful Degradation**: Proper error responses for rate-limited requests

### Data Deletion and Retention

- **GDPR Article 17**: Right to erasure (right to be forgotten)
- **Data Export**: GDPR Article 20 data portability compliance
- **Retention Policies**: Automatic cleanup of inactive accounts
- **Audit Trail Retention**: Maintain security logs for compliance periods

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

1. **Network Security**: HTTPS/TLS for all communications
2. **Authentication**: Strong authentication with AWS Cognito
3. **Authorization**: User-tenant isolation with proper access controls
4. **Application Security**: Input validation, output encoding, secure coding practices
5. **Data Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit
6. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and alerting

### Threat Model

**In Scope:**

- Unauthorized access to user data
- Authentication bypass attempts
- API abuse and rate limiting attacks
- Data breaches and privacy violations
- Session hijacking and token theft

**Out of Scope:**

- Advanced persistent threats (APTs)
- Nation-state attacks
- Financial fraud prevention
- High-frequency trading security
- Enterprise threat hunting

## Compliance Implementation

### GDPR Requirements

- **Lawful Basis**: Legitimate interest for portfolio functionality
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary personal data
- **Consent Management**: Clear consent for data processing
- **Subject Rights**: Implement data export, correction, and deletion
- **Privacy by Design**: Built-in privacy protections
- **Data Protection Impact Assessment**: Document privacy decisions

### Security Monitoring

- **Access Logs**: Monitor all data access patterns
- **Failed Authentication**: Alert on repeated authentication failures
- **Unusual Patterns**: Monitor for abnormal user behavior
- **Security Events**: Track security-relevant application events

## Operational Security

### Secret Management

- **Two-Tier Architecture**: Host-injected core variables with Doppler-managed sensitive tokens
- **Host Environment Variables**: Only core variables (DEV_EMAIL, DEV_USER_NAME, DOPPLER_TOKEN) injected from host
- **Doppler Integration**: All sensitive API keys and tokens managed via Doppler service
- **Container Security**: Automatic secret injection into dev container as environment variables
- **Rotation Strategy**: Regular rotation of long-lived credentials through Doppler
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions for all access

### Incident Response

- **Incident Classification**: Define severity levels and response procedures
- **Communication Plan**: Clear escalation and notification procedures
- **Forensics**: Maintain logs and data for security investigations
- **Recovery Procedures**: Document system recovery and user notification

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets GDPR requirements for EU users
- **Professional Standards**: Demonstrates security best practices
- **User Trust**: Transparent and protective approach to user data
- **Scalable Security**: Foundation that can be enhanced as platform grows
- **Managed Services**: Leverages AWS security features and compliance

### Negative

- **Implementation Overhead**: Additional development effort for compliance features
- **User Experience**: Some security measures may impact user convenience
- **Monitoring Costs**: Additional infrastructure for logging and monitoring
- **Maintenance Burden**: Ongoing security updates and compliance reviews

## Alternatives Considered

- **Minimal Security**: Basic auth only - insufficient for professional platform
- **Enterprise Security**: Full enterprise controls - overkill for current scale
- **Custom Authentication**: Build from scratch - reinventing secure solutions
- **Third-party Security Services**: Additional cost and complexity for current needs

## Future Evolution

- **Enhanced MFA**: Enable multi-factor authentication for admin users
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Implement SIEM and advanced threat detection
- **Compliance Expansion**: Add SOC2 or other compliance frameworks if needed
- **Security Automation**: Automated security testing and vulnerability scanning

## Success Metrics

- **Zero Data Breaches**: No unauthorized access to user data
- **Compliance Audits**: Pass GDPR compliance reviews
- **User Trust**: Positive user feedback on security and privacy
- **Incident Response**: Effective handling of any security events
- **Audit Trail**: Complete and accurate audit logs for all operations
