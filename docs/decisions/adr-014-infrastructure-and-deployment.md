# ADR-014: Infrastructure and Deployment Strategy

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We need to define our CI/CD pipeline, environment management, deployment strategies, and infrastructure as code approach for the platform.

## Decision

### Environment Strategy
- **Production**: Live platform (main branch)
- **Staging**: Pre-production testing (develop branch)
- **Development**: Feature development (feature branches)
- **Ephemeral**: PR preview environments

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions** for all automation
- **Terraform** for infrastructure as code
- **Docker containers** for consistent deployments
- **Automated testing** gates before deployment

### Deployment Strategy
- **Blue/green deployments** for zero downtime
- **Canary releases** for high-risk changes
- **Feature flags** for gradual rollouts
- **Automated rollback** on health check failures

### Infrastructure Components
- **Cloudflare Workers** for compute
- **Neon PostgreSQL** for primary database
- **Cloudflare R2** for static assets
- **Kafka Cloud** for event streaming
- **Redis Cloud** for caching

## Questions for Confirmation

**Deployment Pipeline:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    # Unit tests, integration tests, contract tests
  
  deploy-staging:
    if: branch == 'develop'
    # Deploy to staging environment
  
  deploy-prod:
    if: branch == 'main'
    # Blue/green deployment to production
```

**Questions for you:**
1. Should we implement automated security scanning in the pipeline?
2. What's your preference for secret management? (GitHub secrets, Vault, cloud provider?)
3. Should we set up automatic dependency updates with Dependabot?
4. Do you want infrastructure cost monitoring and alerting?

## Database Migration Strategy
- **Forward-only migrations** with event store compatibility
- **Projection rebuilding** as part of deployment process
- **Migration rollback** capability for emergency scenarios

## Monitoring and Observability
- **Cloudflare Analytics** for basic metrics
- **Custom metrics** via Worker analytics
- **Log aggregation** using Cloudflare Logs
- **Alert integration** with email/Slack

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Kubernetes**: Overkill for Worker-based architecture
2. **Serverless Framework**: Less control than native Cloudflare tooling
3. **Manual deployments**: Not scalable or reliable

## Consequences
- Fully automated deployment pipeline
- Infrastructure as code for reproducibility
- Zero-downtime deployments capability
- Clear environment separation

## Trade-offs
**Benefits:**
- Automated and reliable deployments
- Infrastructure version control
- Multiple environment support
- Rollback capabilities

**Drawbacks:**
- Initial setup complexity
- Pipeline maintenance overhead
- Cloud provider lock-in considerations
```
