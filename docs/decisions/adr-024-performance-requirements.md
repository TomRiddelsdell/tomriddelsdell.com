# ADR-024: Performance Requirements and SLA Definitions

## Status
Proposed

## Decision Drivers
- Need clear performance benchmarks for system implementation
- Required by ADR-010 (Observability Requirements) and ADR-012 (Projection Strategy)
- Essential for capacity planning and infrastructure sizing
- Performance requirements must align with ADR-001 business domain constraints

## Context
The platform requires well-defined performance requirements to guide implementation decisions and establish monitoring thresholds. Without clear performance targets, the system cannot be properly designed, tested, or operated at scale.

## Decision
We will establish comprehensive performance requirements and SLAs covering:

### 1. Response Time Requirements
- **API Endpoints**: 95th percentile < 200ms, 99th percentile < 500ms
- **Query Projections**: 95th percentile < 100ms, 99th percentile < 300ms
- **Event Processing**: Average < 50ms per event, 99th percentile < 200ms
- **Page Load Times**: 95th percentile < 2s, 99th percentile < 4s

### 2. Throughput Requirements
- **API Requests**: 1,000 requests/minute sustained, 5,000 requests/minute peak
- **Event Processing**: 500 events/second sustained, 2,000 events/second peak
- **Concurrent Users**: 100 concurrent users sustained, 500 concurrent users peak
- **Data Volume**: 1GB of new data per day, 10GB total system data

### 3. Availability Requirements
- **System Uptime**: 99.5% availability (43 hours downtime/year)
- **Planned Maintenance**: Maximum 4 hours/month during off-peak hours
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: < 1 hour for complete system recovery
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: < 15 minutes of data loss maximum

### 4. Scalability Requirements
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Auto-scale to 3x baseline capacity within 5 minutes
- **Database Growth**: Support 10x data growth without performance degradation
- **Event Store**: Handle 100x increase in event volume with linear performance
- **Geographic Distribution**: Support multi-region deployment with < 100ms inter-region latency

## Rationale
These performance requirements are based on:

1. **Business Domain Analysis**: Portfolio platform needs from ADR-001
2. **User Experience Goals**: Professional portfolio requires fast, reliable access
3. **Event Sourcing Constraints**: Event processing performance directly impacts system responsiveness
4. **Infrastructure Budget**: Requirements sized for cost-effective cloud deployment
5. **Growth Planning**: 10x headroom for future expansion without architectural changes

## Implementation Guidance

### Phase 1: Baseline Implementation
1. Implement performance monitoring aligned with ADR-010
2. Set up synthetic monitoring for all critical user journeys
3. Establish performance budgets in CI/CD pipeline
4. Create automated performance regression testing

### Phase 2: Optimization
1. Profile application components against SLA targets
2. Optimize database queries and event processing
3. Implement caching strategies for read-heavy operations
4. Tune projection update frequencies

### Phase 3: Scale Testing
1. Conduct load testing at 2x expected peak capacity
2. Validate auto-scaling triggers and behavior
3. Test disaster recovery procedures within RTO/RPO targets
4. Verify geographic distribution performance

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear performance targets for development teams
- Objective criteria for infrastructure sizing decisions
- Proactive performance monitoring and alerting
- Predictable system behavior under load
- Foundation for capacity planning and budgeting

### Negative
- Additional complexity in monitoring and testing infrastructure
- Potential over-engineering for initial deployment scale
- Performance testing overhead in development process
- Infrastructure costs for meeting availability requirements

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Reactive Performance Management
- **Approach**: Address performance issues as they arise
- **Rejected**: Leads to poor user experience and technical debt

### Alternative 2: Conservative Requirements
- **Approach**: Set very high performance targets (sub-100ms everything)
- **Rejected**: Unnecessarily expensive and complex for business domain

### Alternative 3: External SLA Service
- **Approach**: Use third-party performance monitoring SLAs
- **Rejected**: Less control over performance characteristics

## Related ADRs
- **Depends on**: ADR-001 (Business Domain) - Informs performance requirements
- **Supports**: ADR-010 (Observability Requirements) - Defines what to monitor
- **Supports**: ADR-012 (Projection Strategy) - Informs update frequency decisions
- **Supports**: ADR-015 (Deployment Strategy) - Informs infrastructure requirements

## AI Agent Guidance

### Implementation Priority
**High** - These requirements must be established before implementing observability and projection strategies.

### Prerequisites
- ADR-001 business domain understanding
- Basic system architecture in place
- Monitoring infrastructure capacity

### Implementation Steps
1. Set up performance monitoring dashboards
2. Implement synthetic transaction monitoring
3. Configure automated alerting for SLA violations
4. Add performance regression tests to CI/CD
5. Document performance troubleshooting procedures

### Common Pitfalls
- Setting requirements too aggressive for infrastructure budget
- Not considering event sourcing performance characteristics
- Ignoring geographic distribution latency impacts
- Insufficient load testing at scale

### Success Criteria
- All SLA metrics tracked and reported automatically
- Performance regression caught in CI/CD pipeline
- System meets all performance targets under expected load
- Clear escalation procedures for performance incidents
