# Architecture Decision Records Summary

This document provides an index of all architectural decisions made for the tomriddelsdell.com platform.

## ADR Index

### Core Platform Decisions
1. **[Business Domain and Platform Purpose](./adr-business-domain.md)** - Defines the platform as a personal portfolio for quantitative finance

## Key Architectural Principles

Based on the accepted ADRs, the platform follows these core principles:

### 1. **Personal Portfolio First**
- Designed for Tom Riddelsdell's quantitative finance portfolio
- Focus on showcasing technical expertise and professional work
- Open-source friendly with collaboration capabilities

### 2. **Simplicity Over Enterprise Complexity**
- Single-tenant architecture (user = tenant)
- Appropriate scale solutions, not enterprise-grade complexity
- Cost-effective technology choices

### 3. **Security and Privacy by Design**
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Strong authentication with AWS Cognito
- Complete user data isolation
- Professional security standards without enterprise overhead

### 4. **Modern Technology Demonstration**
- Technology choices that showcase best practices
- Event sourcing and CQRS for complex applications
- Cloud-native deployment on Cloudflare/AWS
- TypeScript-first development

### 5. **Professional Quality Standards**
- All work should meet professional presentation standards
- Comprehensive documentation and decision tracking
- Proper testing and quality assurance
- Educational value for the community

## Implementation Roadmap

Based on the ADRs, the implementation should proceed in this order:

1. **Infrastructure Setup** - Terraform for AWS Cognito and base infrastructure
2. **Authentication Integration** - Implement Cognito auth flows in applications
3. **Core Platform Services** - User management, app catalog, and entitlements
4. **Frontend Applications** - Landing page and platform management interfaces
5. **Quantitative Finance Apps** - Domain-specific applications showcasing expertise
6. **Observability and Monitoring** - Comprehensive logging and monitoring
7. **Security Hardening** - GDPR compliance features and security enhancements

## ADR Governance

### When to Create an ADR
- Any architectural decision that affects multiple services or applications
- Technology stack choices and changes
- Security and compliance decisions
- Scalability and performance trade-offs
- Decisions that will be difficult to reverse

### ADR Review Process
1. Draft ADR with context, decision, and rationale
2. Review with relevant stakeholders (in this case, Tom Riddelsdell)
3. Consider alternatives and consequences
4. Accept, reject, or defer the decision
5. Implement and monitor outcomes

### Updating ADRs
- ADRs should be updated when decisions change
- Mark superseded ADRs as "Superseded by [new ADR]"
- Maintain historical record of decision evolution
- Document lessons learned from implemented decisions
