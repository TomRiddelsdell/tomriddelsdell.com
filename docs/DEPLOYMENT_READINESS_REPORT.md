## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup
Ensure the following environment variables are configured:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
VITE_AWS_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
VITE_AWS_COGNITO_REGION=your_region
VITE_AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=your_pool_id
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
```

### 2. Production Deployment
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start
```

### 3. Health Check Endpoints
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Authentication status
- `GET /api/monitoring/status` - System health
- `GET /api/monitoring/performance` - Performance metrics

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Response Times**: API endpoints under 200ms
- **Error Rates**: <1% for critical paths
- **Authentication Success**: >99% login success rate
- **Database Performance**: Query times under 100ms

### Alert Thresholds
- **High Priority**: Authentication failures, database connectivity
- **Medium Priority**: Response time degradation, memory usage
- **Low Priority**: Non-critical feature availability

## Support and Maintenance

### Ongoing Tasks
- **Regular Security Audits**: Monthly vulnerability assessments
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous metrics collection
- **Code Quality**: Maintain clean architecture principles
- **Feature Development**: Complete analytics domain implementation

### Troubleshooting Resources
