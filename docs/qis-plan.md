# QIS System Implementation Plan

## Implementation Strategy

This plan outlines the specific steps, phases, and deliverables required to implement the QIS system as defined in `qis-objective.md`. The implementation follows Domain Driven Design principles and integrates seamlessly with the existing tomriddelsdell.com architecture.

## Reference Implementation: Ethereum Moving Average Crossover Strategy

Throughout this implementation plan, we will use an **Ethereum Moving Average Crossover Strategy** as our concrete example and reference implementation. This strategy will demonstrate all core QIS capabilities while remaining simple enough to understand and extend.

### Strategy Overview
- **Instrument**: Ethereum (ETH/USD)
- **Signal**: Moving average crossover (e.g., 20-day MA crosses above/below 50-day MA)
- **Execution**: Paper trading initially, designed for seamless transition to live execution
- **Risk Management**: Position sizing based on volatility, maximum drawdown limits
- **Data Sources**: Real-time crypto data feeds (starting with free APIs like CoinGecko)

### Strategy Modules Composition
1. **Data Module**: ETH price data ingestion and normalization
2. **Signal Module**: Moving average calculation and crossover detection
3. **Weight Module**: Position sizing based on signal strength and risk parameters
4. **Risk Module**: Volatility-based position sizing and drawdown protection
5. **Execution Module**: Paper trading with realistic fill simulation
6. **Performance Module**: P&L tracking and Sharpe ratio calculation

This example strategy will evolve through each implementation phase, demonstrating:
- Modular strategy construction
- Real-time data processing
- Risk management integration
- Performance monitoring
- Paper trading simulation
- Documentation generation
