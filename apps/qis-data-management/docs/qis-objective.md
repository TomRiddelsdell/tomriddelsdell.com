# Quantitative Investment Strategy (QIS) System Objective

## Mission Statement

Build a enterprise-grade systematic trading platform that enables the creation, testing, and execution of quantitative investment strategies through a modular, enterprise-ready architecture.

## System Vision

The QIS system represents the ultimate goal of creating a comprehensive platform for implementing systematic trading strategies with institutional-grade capabilities. This system will serve as the foundation for quantitative research, strategy development, risk management, and automated trading execution.

## Ubiquitous Language

### Data Management

**Reference Data ID**: A uniquely name for some timeseries data.

**Data Source**: A provider of data producing a stream of Data Values at different Snaps

**Snap**: The Event Time associated with a Data Value. This Data Value arrives in the application at the Processing Time

**As Of Time**: This is the Processing Time for a Data Value

**Official Data Value**: A Data Value that has been reconciled across many sources for which we have high trust in its accuracy

**Publication**: A Data Value may be published for a specific Snap to be made available to 3rd parties

**Restatement**: The changing and republication of an Official Data Value once it's already been published.

**Remark**: The changing of a Data Value.

**Data Lineage**: The complete path and transformation history of data from source to consumption

**Data Quality Metric**: Measurable criteria used to assess the reliability and accuracy of data

**Corporate Action**: Events like dividends, splits, mergers, or other corporate events affecting instrument valuations

**Market Data Snapshot**: A complete set of market data captured at a specific point in time

### Strategy Framework

**Signal**: A piece of market data that may be used to determine Target Weights

**Target Weights**: The percentage allocation in the Strategy's Constituents using valuations as of the Observation Snap (there may be a lag between the Observation Snap and the Target Weight Generation Time to facilitate looking forward to upcoming rebalances to enable hedging)

**Effective Weights**: The percentage allocation in the Strategy's Constituents using the most recent available valuations as of the Snap

**Constituent**: An Instrument a Strategy holds at a specific Snap

**Position**: The number of units a Strategy holds of an Instrument at a specific Snap

**Instrument**: Something a Strategy may trade. It could be a directly observable market instrument (e.g. stock, bond, future, option, ETF) or an indirectly observable instrument (e.g. another Strategy, a combination of other Instruments)

**Trade**: The process of generating an Order on an Instrument and having it Filled at specific prices

**Order**: The representation of the intention to buy or sell a specific number of units in line with an Execution Instruction

**Execution Instruction**: The methodology with which the Order should be Executed in the Market. Different Execution Instructions will result in different Fill Prices and Execution Fractions

**Price**: The Data Value representing the value of an Instrument at a Snap as specified by a specific Data Source

**Denomination Currency**: The currency in which the Strategy Value is quoted

### Module Framework

**Module**: The representation of a specific part of the Strategy Definition. A Module should have well-defined Module Parameters, Module Methodology, Sub Modules, Data Dependencies, and Module Outputs. A Module should be "documentable" and independent of other Modules that are not specified as Sub Modules

**Module Parameters**: The configuration of a Module that doesn't change throughout the life of a Strategy

**Module Methodology**: The definition of the Module Outputs w.r.t. its Parameters, Sub Module Outputs, Data Dependencies and Snap Schedule

**Module Output**: The Data Values produced by a Module for Snaps in the Snap Schedule

**Snap Schedule**: The set of Snaps for which the Module Output is well defined and expected to be calculated

**Sub Module/Child Module**: The Module Output of a Sub Module for a specific Snap is used to compute the Module Output of the Parent Module

**Data Dependency**: A Data Value or Values required by a Module in order to compute the Module Output

**Trading Module**: Specific module types for which the Module Output is sets of Orders

### Strategy Lifecycle

**Live Period**: The set of snaps after and including the Strategy Inception

**Strategy Inception**: The first Snap at which the Strategy starts evolving

**Backtest**: An extended set of Snaps and Levels starting earlier than the Strategy Inception in order to gain insight of the strategy's evolution over a the longest possible period of time

**Backtest Assumptions**: The set of assumptions made in order to extend the strategy calculation back to the Backtest Start Date

**Backtest Merge Date**: The date on which the Backtest can be merged with the Live Period; usually after any Ramp Up Period in the Live Period

**Ramp Up Period**: The set of snaps from the Strategy Inception where the Strategy is building up it's positions gradually in order to limit initial Market Impact

**Observation Time**: A snap at which Data Values are taken to compute a derived Data Value

**Observation Window**: A set of snaps from which a derived Data Value is taken

### Implementation & Validation
