# FlowCreate Platform Development Plan

## Rules For Replit
1. Explain what you’ll do first and ask for my confirmation before coding.
2. Only make requested changes.
3. Do not write duplicate code without confirmation - please look for existing solutions in the codebase and if found ask whether we should reuse, centralize or duplicate.
4. Always run relevant tests before commiting a change in Source Control.
5. Always follow DDD and TDD best practices

## Project Management Roadmap & Constraints

### Overview
Transform FlowCreate into a professional platform with enhanced monitoring capabilities, decoupled application architecture, and systematic trading analysis tools while maintaining strict Domain Driven Design (DDD) principles and testing best practices.

## Phase 0: Security Hardening & Configuration Management (CRITICAL)

### Objectives
Address critical security vulnerabilities and implement centralized configuration management before proceeding with feature development.

### Critical Security Issues Identified

### Configuration Management Implementation
1. **Centralized Configuration System**
   - Type-safe configuration schemas with Zod validation
   - Environment-specific configuration loading
   - Comprehensive startup validation
   - Hot-reload capability for configuration changes

2. **Security Policy Configuration**
   - Configurable CORS allowed origins
   - Rate limiting thresholds per environment
   - Session security parameters
   - CSP directives management

3. **Service Configuration Externalization**
   - Database connection and pool settings
   - API endpoint URLs and timeouts

## Cross-Phase Constraints & Guidelines

### Domain Driven Design (DDD) Principles
1. **Bounded Contexts**
   - Clear domain boundaries with explicit interfaces
   - No direct cross-domain database access
   - Domain-specific ubiquitous language
   - Anti-corruption layers for external integrations

2. **Domain Model Integrity**
   - Rich domain models with business logic
   - Aggregate consistency boundaries
   - Domain events for cross-boundary communication
   - Value objects for data integrity

3. **Architecture Layers**
   - Domain layer independent of infrastructure
   - Application services coordinate use cases
   - Infrastructure adapters implement interfaces
   - Interface layer handles external communication

### Testing Best Practices
1. **Test Pyramid Strategy**
   - Unit tests for domain logic (70%)
   - Integration tests for service boundaries (20%)
   - End-to-end tests for critical user journeys (10%)

2. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Red-Green-Refactor cycle
   - Behavior-driven scenarios for acceptance criteria

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Automated test execution in CI/CD
   - Test data management and isolation
   - Performance and load testing for critical paths
   - Security testing for authentication and authorization

### Safety & Reliability
1. **Change Management**
   - Feature flags for gradual rollouts
   - Database migrations with rollback plans
   - Blue-green deployment strategy
   - Comprehensive monitoring during deployments

2. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation for service failures
   - Circuit breaker patterns for external services
   - Comprehensive error logging and alerting
   - User-friendly error messages

3. **Data Protection**
   - Backup and recovery procedures
   - Data encryption at rest and in transit
   - Audit logging for sensitive operations
