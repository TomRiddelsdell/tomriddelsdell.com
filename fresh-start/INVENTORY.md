## What's Preserved

### ✅ Essential Assets
- **Hero background image** - Professional landscape photo
- **Profile photo** - Personal headshot for bio section
- **All original documentation** - Complete project history and lessons

### ✅ Knowledge Base
- **Architecture decisions** - Why choices were made
- **Deployment lessons** - What worked and what didn't
- **Security implementation** - Best practices and configurations
- **Technology evaluation** - Pros/cons of different approaches
- **Cost analysis** - Infrastructure expense breakdown
- **Performance insights** - Optimization strategies

## What's Removed

### ❌ Complex Code
- All source code (React, TypeScript, Express.js)
- Database schemas and migrations
- AWS infrastructure as code
- Authentication implementation
- API endpoints and business logic

### ❌ Dependencies
- node_modules and package.json
- Build configurations
- Environment files with secrets
- Complex tooling setup

### ❌ Infrastructure
- AWS Lambda functions
- API Gateway configurations
- Database connections
- Authentication providers
- Monitoring and analytics

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Start Simple** - Create a basic HTML/CSS homepage
2. **Add Styling** - Use Tailwind CSS or similar for clean design
3. **Make it Responsive** - Ensure mobile-first design
4. **Add Contact Form** - Use Netlify Forms or similar service
5. **Deploy Simply** - Use Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages

## Technologies for Next Implementation

### Phase 1: Static Site
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Netlify or Vercel for hosting
- Netlify Forms for contact

### Phase 2: Dynamic Features (if needed)
- React for interactivity
- Vite for build tooling
- Simple deployment pipeline

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (only if necessary)
- Backend API (Node.js, Python, or Go)
- Database (only for user-generated content)
- Authentication (only for admin features)

## Documentation Value

The preserved documentation contains:
- **Architectural patterns** that worked well
- **Pitfalls to avoid** in AWS serverless deployment
- **Cost optimization** strategies for cloud infrastructure
- **Security best practices** for web applications
- **Performance optimization** lessons learned

This knowledge base will help you make informed decisions about what to include in the new implementation and what to avoid based on real experience.
