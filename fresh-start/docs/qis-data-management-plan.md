# QIS Data Management Domain - Implementation Sub-Plan

## Domain Overview

The QIS Data Management Domain serves as the **Golden Source of Truth** for all timeseries reference data within the QIS ecosystem. This domain implements a comprehensive data management system capable of handling both primitive types (doubles, integers) and complex user-defined types (e.g., SPX options universe snapshots) with complete audit trails and temporal versioning.

## Reference Implementation: ETH Price Data with Options Universe

Throughout this implementation, we will demonstrate the domain capabilities using:
- **Primary Example**: Ethereum (ETH/USD) price timeseries with minute-level granularity
- **Complex Type Example**: S&P 500 listed options universe snapshots (daily)
- **Audit Example**: Corporate actions affecting ETH futures contracts

## Domain Boundaries & Responsibilities

### Core Responsibilities
- **Reference Data Management**: Central registry and storage of all timeseries data references
- **Data Source Integration**: Ingestion from multiple providers with reconciliation capabilities
- **Audit Trail Maintenance**: Complete lineage tracking from source to official values
- **Temporal Data Management**: Point-in-time queries and historical reconstruction
- **Data Quality Assurance**: Validation, cleansing, and quality metrics
- **Publication Management**: Controlled release of official data values to downstream systems

### Bounded Context Interfaces
- **Inbound**: Raw data from external providers (Bloomberg, CoinGecko, etc.)
- **Outbound**: Official data values to Strategy Domain and Risk Management Domain
- **Event Publishing**: Data quality alerts, restatements, and publication events
