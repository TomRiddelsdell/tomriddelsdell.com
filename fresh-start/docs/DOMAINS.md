# Domain Documentation - tomriddelsdell.com Platform

This document provides a comprehensive overview of all domains in the tomriddelsdell.com workflow automation platform, implementing Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

## Domain Architecture Overview

The tomriddelsdell.com platform is organized into multiple bounded contexts, each representing a distinct business domain with its own ubiquitous language, models, and responsibilities.

## Core Domains

### 1. Identity Domain (`domains/identity/`)

**Purpose**: Manages user authentication, authorization, and identity lifecycle within the platform.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- User registration and authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- User profile management
- Integration with AWS Cognito (via Anti-Corruption Layer)
- Domain events for user lifecycle

**Key Entities & Value Objects**:
- `User` (Aggregate Root) - Core user entity with business logic
- `UserId` - Strongly-typed user identifier
- `Email` - Validated email value object
- `CognitoId` - External identity provider integration
- `UserRole` - Role enumeration (USER, ADMIN, EDITOR)

**Domain Events**:
- `UserRegisteredEvent`
- `UserAuthenticatedEvent`
- `UserProfileUpdatedEvent`

**Business Rules**:
- Email uniqueness across the platform
- Role-based permission enforcement
- User activation/deactivation lifecycle
- Integration with external identity providers

---

## 2. Integration Domain (`domains/integration/`)

**Purpose**: Manages external service integrations and connected applications.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Third-party service connections
- API credential management
- Integration health monitoring
- Data synchronization
- Rate limiting and throttling

**Key Entities & Value Objects**:
- `ConnectedApp` - External service integration
- `IntegrationId` - Integration identifier
- `ApiCredentials` - Secure credential storage
- `ConnectionStatus` - Integration health state
- `IntegrationConfig` - Service-specific configuration

**Domain Events**:
- `AppConnectedEvent`
- `AppDisconnectedEvent`
- `IntegrationFailedEvent`
- `DataSyncedEvent`

**Business Rules**:
- Credential encryption requirements
- Connection timeout limits
- Rate limiting per integration
- Health check intervals
- User permission for integrations

---

### 3. Analytics Domain (`domains/analytics/`)

**Purpose**: Provides insights, metrics, and reporting capabilities for workflows and system performance.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Workflow performance metrics
- System usage analytics
- Custom dashboard creation
- Report generation
- Alert and threshold management

**Key Entities & Value Objects**:
- `Metric` - Performance measurement entity
- `Dashboard` - Custom analytics view
- `Report` - Generated analytics report
- `MetricValue` - Typed measurement values
- `TimeRange` - Temporal query boundaries
- `Threshold` - Alert trigger conditions

**Domain Events**:
- `MetricCollectedEvent`
- `ThresholdExceededEvent`
- `ReportGeneratedEvent`
- `DashboardCreatedEvent`

**Business Rules**:
- Data retention policies
- Metric aggregation rules
- Dashboard sharing permissions
- Alert frequency limits
- Report scheduling constraints

---

### 4. Notification Domain (`domains/notification/`)

**Purpose**: Handles all platform notifications, alerts, and communication channels.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Multi-channel notification delivery
- Notification preferences management
- Template and formatting
- Delivery status tracking
- User notification settings

**Key Entities & Value Objects**:
- `Notification` - Core notification entity
- `NotificationChannel` - Delivery method (email, SMS, in-app)
- `NotificationTemplate` - Message formatting
- `DeliveryStatus` - Tracking notification delivery
- `UserPreferences` - Individual notification settings

**Domain Events**:
- `NotificationSentEvent`
- `NotificationDeliveredEvent`
- `NotificationFailedEvent`
- `PreferencesUpdatedEvent`

**Business Rules**:
- Channel preference enforcement
- Rate limiting per user
- Template validation rules
- Delivery retry policies
- Opt-out compliance

---

## Shared Kernel (`domains/shared-kernel/`)

**Purpose**: Common domain concepts, value objects, and patterns shared across all bounded contexts.

**Key Components**:

### Value Objects
- `UserId` - User identification across domains
- `Email` - Validated email addresses
- `CognitoId` - External identity provider IDs
- Common validation patterns

### Domain Events
- `DomainEvent` - Base event class
- Event publishing infrastructure
- Cross-domain event handling
- Event sourcing foundations

### Domain Services
- `DomainEventPublisher` - Event distribution
- Cross-cutting domain logic
- Shared business rules

### Exception Handling
- `DomainException` - Business rule violations
- Validation error patterns
- Consistent error messaging

### Specifications
- Business rule specifications
- Query object patterns
- Composite criteria handling

## Domain Interactions

### Inter-Domain Communication
Domains communicate through:
1. **Domain Events** - Asynchronous, decoupled communication
2. **Application Services** - Orchestrated cross-domain operations
3. **Anti-Corruption Layers** - External system integration

### Event Flow Examples
```
User Registration Flow:
Identity Domain â†’ UserRegisteredEvent â†’ Analytics Domain (metrics)
                                    â†’ Notification Domain (welcome email)

Workflow Execution Flow:
Workflow Domain â†’ WorkflowExecutedEvent â†’ Analytics Domain (performance)
                                       â†’ Integration Domain (trigger APIs)
                                       â†’ Notification Domain (status updates)
```

### Bounded Context Boundaries
Each domain maintains:
- Independent data models
- Separate databases/schemas
- Domain-specific validation rules
- Isolated business logic
- Clear interface contracts

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Fully Implemented
- **Identity Domain**: Complete with AWS Cognito integration
- **Workflow Domain**: Core workflow logic and business rules
- **Shared Kernel**: Events, value objects, domain services

### ðŸš§ Partially Implemented
- **Analytics Domain**: Basic structure, needs metric collection
- **Integration Domain**: Framework exists, needs service implementations
- **Notification Domain**: Base structure, needs channel implementations

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
1. Complete Analytics Domain metric collection
2. Implement Integration Domain service connectors
3. Build Notification Domain delivery channels
4. Add cross-domain event handling
5. Implement domain-specific repositories

---

## Testing Strategy

Each domain includes:
- **Unit Tests**: Business logic validation
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-boundary testing
- **Domain Event Tests**: Event handling verification
- **Business Rule Tests**: Constraint enforcement

Current test coverage focuses on core domains (Identity, Workflow) with comprehensive business rule validation.

This architecture ensures clear separation of concerns, maintainable code, and scalable business logic that aligns with real-world workflow automation requirements.
