```

### Key Architectural Principles

**Domain-Centric Design**: All business logic resides in the domain layer with clear bounded contexts for Identity, Workflow, Analytics, Integration, and Notification domains.

**Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between domain logic, application services, infrastructure, and interface layers.

**Anti-Corruption Layers**: External services are isolated through adapters that prevent external concepts from contaminating the domain.

**Event-Driven Architecture**: Domain events enable loose coupling between aggregates and bounded contexts.

---

## Domain Layer Implementation

### Identity Domain

**Core Responsibilities**: User authentication, authorization, profile management, and account lifecycle.

**Key Components**:
- **UserAggregate**: Encapsulates user registration, authentication, and profile management
- **Value Objects**: Email, CognitoId, UserId with proper validation and business rules
- **Business Rules**: Authentication constraints, role management, account lifecycle policies
- **Domain Events**: UserRegistered, UserAuthenticated for cross-domain communication

**Business Logic Examples**:
```typescript
// User registration with domain rules
const userAggregate = UserAggregate.register(
  email, cognitoId, username, displayName
);

// Authentication with business rule enforcement
userAggregate.authenticate(ipAddress);

// Role changes with proper validation
user.changeRole(UserRole.ADMIN);
```

### Workflow Domain

**Core Responsibilities**: Workflow creation, validation, execution, and lifecycle management.

**Key Components**:
- **WorkflowAggregate**: Manages workflow creation, activation, and execution
- **Value Objects**: WorkflowId, trigger types, action configurations
- **Domain Services**: WorkflowValidationService for complex business logic
- **Business Rules**: Action limits, status transitions, execution constraints

**Business Logic Examples**:
```typescript
// Workflow creation with validation
const workflowAggregate = WorkflowAggregate.create(
  userId, name, description, triggerType
);

// Business rule enforcement
workflowAggregate.activateWorkflow(); // Validates actions exist

// Complex validation through domain services
validationService.validateWorkflowForActivation(workflow);
```

### Shared Kernel

**Core Responsibilities**: Common domain concepts, events, and cross-cutting domain services.

**Key Components**:
- **Domain Events**: Publisher/subscriber pattern for loose coupling
- **Value Objects**: Common identifiers and data types
- **Specifications**: Composable business rule patterns
- **Domain Services**: Cross-cutting domain concerns

**Pattern Examples**:
```typescript
// Event publishing
await DomainEventPublisher.getInstance().publish(
  new UserRegisteredEvent(userId, email, cognitoId)
);

// Specification composition
const activeAdminSpec = UserSpecifications.active()
  .and(UserSpecifications.admin());

// Business rule evaluation
if (activeAdminSpec.isSatisfiedBy(user)) {
  // Handle active admin logic
}
```

---

## Application Services

### Service Orchestration

**Identity Service**: Coordinates user management workflows, handles authentication flows, and manages user lifecycle operations.

**Workflow Service**: Orchestrates workflow creation, validation, execution, and monitoring processes.

**Notification Service**: Manages cross-domain event handling and communication workflows.

### Use Case Implementation

**Command Handlers**: Process domain commands while maintaining transaction boundaries and business rule enforcement.

**Query Handlers**: Implement read model optimization with proper data projection and filtering.

**Event Handlers**: Handle inter-domain communication through domain events with proper error handling and retry logic.

### Integration Patterns

```typescript
// Command handling with domain validation
export class CreateWorkflowHandler {
  async handle(command: CreateWorkflowCommand): Promise<WorkflowId> {
    const aggregate = WorkflowAggregate.create(
      command.userId, command.name, command.description, command.triggerType
    );
    
    await this.repository.save(aggregate);
    await this.eventPublisher.publishMany(aggregate.getDomainEvents());
    
    return aggregate.getWorkflow().getId();
  }
}
```

---

## Infrastructure Layer

### Anti-Corruption Layers

**CognitoAdapter**: Translates AWS Cognito data structures to domain models, preventing external service concepts from contaminating the domain layer.

**External Service Isolation**: All external integrations go through adapters that maintain domain integrity.

**Data Transformation**: Proper mapping between external formats and internal domain representations.

```typescript
// Anti-corruption layer example
export class CognitoAdapter {
  static toDomainUser(cognitoUser: any): User {
    return User.create(
      UserId.generate(),
      new Email(this.extractAttribute(cognitoUser.UserAttributes, 'email')),
      new CognitoId(cognitoUser.Username),
      this.extractAttribute(cognitoUser.UserAttributes, 'preferred_username'),
      this.extractAttribute(cognitoUser.UserAttributes, 'name')
    );
  }
}
```

### Database Integration

**Repository Pattern**: Clean data access abstraction with domain-aligned interfaces.

**Schema Management**: Drizzle ORM with type-safe migrations and domain-specific schemas.

**Connection Management**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling and proper transaction handling.

### Security Implementation

**Authentication**: AWS Cognito integration with complete domain isolation through anti-corruption layers.

**Authorization**: Role-based access control implemented through domain models and specifications.

**Session Management**: Secure session handling with proper cleanup and token management.

**Request/Response Models**: Clean separation from domain models with proper data transfer objects.

**Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages that maintain domain language.

**Security Middleware**: Authentication, authorization, and rate limiting implemented at the interface boundary.

### Web Frontend

**Component Architecture**: Domain-aligned UI components that reflect business concepts and workflows.

**State Management**: React Query for server state management with proper caching and synchronization.

**Form Handling**: Type-safe forms with validation that mirrors domain validation rules.

describe('User Aggregate Root', () => {
  it('should enforce business rules during registration', () => {
    expect(() => {
      UserAggregate.register(email, cognitoId, '', 'Test User');
    }).toThrow(DomainException);
  });

  it('should emit domain events for business operations', () => {
    const events = userAggregate.getDomainEvents();
    expect(events[0]).toBeInstanceOf(UserRegisteredEvent);
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests
