# TomRiddelsdell.com - Fresh Start

**Date Created:** September 3, 2025  
**Purpose:** Clean slate for rebuilding the personal website  

## What's Included

### ðŸ“¸ Assets
- `assets/background.jpg` - Hero section background image
- `assets/me.jpg` - Profile photo

### ðŸ“š Documentation
- `docs/CONSOLIDATED_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete project history and lessons learned
- `docs/` - All previous documentation and architectural decisions

## Next Steps

This fresh start provides you with:

1. **Visual Assets** - The core photos needed for the home page
2. **Complete Documentation** - All the knowledge gained from the previous implementation
3. **Clean Slate** - No existing code to maintain or debug

## Recommended Approach

For the new implementation, consider:

1. **Start Simple** - Begin with a static HTML/CSS site
2. **Progressive Enhancement** - Add React/TypeScript only when needed
3. **Simple Hosting** - Use Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages
4. **Minimal Dependencies** - Avoid complex infrastructure until proven necessary

## Technologies to Consider

### For a Simple Start
- Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Single page application

### For Dynamic Features (later)
- React + TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Simple form handling with Netlify Forms or similar

### For Advanced Features (much later)
- Backend API only when absolutely needed
- Database only for user-generated content
- Authentication only for admin features

## Key Lessons from Previous Implementation

1. **AWS Lambda is complex** - Consider simpler hosting first
2. **Authentication adds complexity** - Only add when truly needed
3. **Database connections are tricky in serverless** - Avoid until necessary
4. **Infrastructure as Code is powerful but complex** - Start simple and evolve

## Documentation Reference

See `docs/CONSOLIDATED_DOCUMENTATION.md` for the complete history, architectural decisions, and technical lessons learned from the previous implementation.
