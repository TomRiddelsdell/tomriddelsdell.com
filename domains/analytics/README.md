# Analytics Domain

## Overview
The Analytics domain handles metrics collection, reporting, and monitoring capabilities for the platform. It provides insights into system performance, user behavior, and workflow execution patterns.

## Entities
- **Metric**: Performance measurements with timestamps and context
- **Dashboard**: Custom analytics views for users
- **Report**: Generated analytics reports with filters and time ranges
- **Alert**: Threshold-based monitoring and notification rules

## Value Objects
- **MetricValue**: Typed measurement values (counter, gauge, timer, percentage, bytes)
- **TimeRange**: Temporal query boundaries with validation
- **Dimension**: Categorization and filtering dimensions
- **Threshold**: Alert trigger conditions with comparison operators

## Domain Services
- **MetricCollectionService**: Handles metric gathering and processing
- **ReportingService**: Generates reports and analytics
- **AlertService**: Monitors thresholds and triggers notifications
- **DashboardService**: Manages custom analytics views

## Repository Interfaces
- **IMetricRepository**: Metric data persistence and querying
- **IReportRepository**: Report storage and retrieval
- **IDashboardRepository**: Dashboard configuration storage

## Domain Events
- **MetricCollectedEvent**: Published when new metrics are recorded
- **ThresholdExceededEvent**: Published when alert conditions are met
- **ReportGeneratedEvent**: Published when reports are created
- **DashboardCreatedEvent**: Published when new dashboards are built

## Business Rules
1. Metrics must have valid timestamps and positive values
2. Dashboards belong to specific users with appropriate permissions
3. Reports must have valid time ranges (start < end)
4. Alert thresholds must be within reasonable bounds
5. Users can only access their own data unless explicitly shared

## Metric Types
- **Counter**: Cumulative values that only increase (executions, registrations)
- **Gauge**: Current values that fluctuate (active users, memory usage)
- **Timer**: Duration measurements (response times, execution times)
- **Percentage**: Ratio measurements (success rates, error rates)
- **Bytes**: Data size measurements (processed data, storage usage)

## Usage Examples

### Recording Metrics
```typescript
const metric = Metric.create(
    'workflow-execution-time',
    MetricValue.timer(1500, 'ms'),
    [Dimension.workflow('workflow123'), Dimension.user('user456')]
);
await metricRepository.save(metric);
```

### Creating Alerts
```typescript
const alert = Alert.create(
    'high-error-rate',
    Threshold.greaterThan(5, 'critical'),
    { channels: ['email'], cooldownMinutes: 30 }
);
```
